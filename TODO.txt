P1 - Blocking / Critical

1) Fix orders sent without dimensions ✅
- Dimensions are visible in the back office but missing in order/invoice PDFs.
- Goal: properly store and render dimensions in PDF documents.

2) Global validation before cart / checkout✅
- Add strict validation before add-to-cart and checkout.
- Conditional checklist (depending on use case):
  - dimensions
  - thickness
  - material
  - shape(s)
  - holes
  - text
- Normalize numeric input: remove commas (example: 12,5 -> 12.5).

3) Fix diameter / radius display
- Standardize and stabilize display for diameter/radius dimensions.✅


P2 - Business Features

4) Pricing - dedicated admin dashboard
- Admin interface to manage pricing grids for:
  - shapes
  - thicknesses
  - materials
  - finishes
  - linear metrics

5) Pricing by shape
- Allow fixed/unit price per shape type.
- Must be compatible with thickness and material.

6) Cutting price per linear meter
- Define a EUR/m rate applied dynamically based on total perimeter.

7) Finishing price per linear meter
- Define a EUR/m rate for each finish type.

8) Thickness-based grid
- For each thickness, define:
  - linear cutting price
  - linear finishing price
  - surcharges

9) CAD-ready SVG (1:1 scale)
- Export/generate SVG at real scale.


P3 - Customer Experience

10) Save my customization (cart)
- "Save" button (logged-in customer required).
- Store all options: shapes, holes, text, thickness, finishes.

11) Simulation list in customer account
- "My simulations" page:
  - list
  - rename
  - duplicate
  - delete
  - show thumbnail preview

12) Restore a simulation in the editor
- Open a simulation from "My simulations".
- Reload full parameters and recalculate price.


P4 - Front-office Performance

13) Advanced performance optimization
- Audit JS/CSS (theme + modules), identify unnecessary/blocking resources (LCP/TBT/CLS).
- Load JS/CSS conditionally by page (home, product, category, checkout).
- Optimize JS execution: defer/async, delay non-critical scripts, remove duplicates.
- Clean up/disable non-essential hooks or modules on specific pages.
- Minify/concatenate/bundle based on theme/module compatibility.
- Optimize fonts and icons.
- Measure before/after (Lighthouse/PageSpeed) and document recommendations.


Current Status (reference)
- Showing dimensions outside preview: in progress / partially done.
- Remaining points above must be finalized and validated.
